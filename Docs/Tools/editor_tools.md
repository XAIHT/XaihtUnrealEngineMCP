# Unreal MCP Editor Tools

This document provides detailed information about the editor tools available in the Unreal MCP integration.

## Overview

Editor tools allow you to control the Unreal Editor viewport and other editor functionality through MCP commands. These tools are particularly useful for automating tasks like focusing the camera on specific actors or locations.

## Editor Tools

### focus_viewport

Focus the viewport on a specific actor or location.

**Parameters:**
- `target` (string, optional) - Name of the actor to focus on (if provided, location is ignored)
- `location` (array, optional) - [X, Y, Z] coordinates to focus on (used if target is None)
- `distance` (float, optional) - Distance from the target/location (default: 1000.0)
- `orientation` (array, optional) - [Pitch, Yaw, Roll] for the viewport camera

**Returns:**
- Response from Unreal Engine containing the result of the focus operation

**Example:**
```json
{
  "command": "focus_viewport",
  "params": {
    "target": "PlayerStart",
    "distance": 500,
    "orientation": [0, 180, 0]
  }
}
```

### take_screenshot

Capture a screenshot of the active editor viewport and save it to disk.

**Parameters:**
- `filepath` (string) - Path to save the screenshot to. A `.png` extension is
  added automatically if it is missing.

**Returns:**
- Dict containing the saved file path on success, or an error message.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "command": "take_screenshot",
  "params": {
    "filepath": "C:/temp/my_scene.png"
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

All command responses include a "status" field indicating whether the operation succeeded, and an optional "message" field with details in case of failure.

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Failed to get active viewport"
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Python Example

```python
from unreal_mcp_server import get_unreal_connection

# Get connection to Unreal Engine
unreal = get_unreal_connection()

# Focus on a specific actor
focus_response = unreal.send_command("focus_viewport", {
    "target": "PlayerStart",
    "distance": 500,
    "orientation": [0, 180, 0]
})
print(focus_response)

# Take a screenshot (a .png extension is added automatically if missing)
screenshot_response = unreal.send_command("take_screenshot", {"filepath": "C:/temp/my_scene.png"})
print(screenshot_response)
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Command fails with "Failed to get active viewport"**: Make sure Unreal Editor is running and has an active viewport.
- **Actor not found**: Verify that the actor name is correct and the actor exists in the current level.
- **Invalid parameters**: Ensure that location and orientation arrays contain exactly 3 values (X, Y, Z for location; Pitch, Yaw, Roll for orientation).

## Future Enhancements

- Support for setting viewport display mode (wireframe, lit, etc.)
- Camera animation paths for cinematic viewport control
- Support for multiple viewports
